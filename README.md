**Machine learning to predict time to failure of lab earthquakes from acoustic emissions**  

This repository contains a machine learning-based approach to predict the *time to failure* of lab earthquakes using acoustic emission data.

## What's This About?  
We use acoustic signals from lab-simulated earthquakes to estimate when failure will occur. The project explores machine learning techniques applied to these signals to make accurate predictions.

The code is experimental and not production-readyâ€”it was built to test ideas and run experiments.
